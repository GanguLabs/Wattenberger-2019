        When I visualize data on the web, my current favorite environment is
        using <b>D3.js</b> inside of a <b>React.js</b> application. These two
        technologies are notoriously tricky to combine. Here's my opinionated
        guide to living with both, in harmony.

        Usually, we position elements on our web pages in static, explicit
        places. But what if we want to make them feel more alive, or move them
        based on loose rules? Let's learn how to move particles with forces
        using d3-force.

        One of the CSS units I use most is the wonderful <b>%</b> — so handy for
        positioning elements on the page. Unfortunately, the rules aren’t
        exactly straightforward. One question I’m always asking myself is:{" "}

        D3.js force simulations are great for implementing basic physical rules,
        but they can be expensive to run. Here's a trick I've used in the past
        to speed up those simulations.

        Let's create a Gauge in React! Gauges are great at showing context
        around a single value. Is it high or low? Is it larger or smaller than
        this other value? But what we'll learn here isn't really about creating
        a gauge, it's about learning the concepts we could use to create one.

        Scaling svgs can be a daunting task, since they act very differently

        understanding of viewBox and change our mindset.

        React introduced hooks one year ago, and they've been a game-changer for
